# joey.bot
This Skype Bot made for a small private chat with friends back in 2015. It consisted of games and funny jokes.
This project has since been abandoned and is no longer used but is a great example of how I learned and used Java.

This project helped me learn more about OOP and static methods and also about using a Linux based system to keep the bot functional throughout a couple of days.
